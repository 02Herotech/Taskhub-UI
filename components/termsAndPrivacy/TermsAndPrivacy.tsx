                    <li>1.4 If a Poster accepts an Offer on the TaskHub Platform, a Task Contract is created between the service and the Poster.</li>
                    <li className='my-2'>1.5 Upon creation of a Task Contract, the Poster must pay the Agreed Price into the Payment Account.</li>

                2. TASKHUB'S ROLE AND OBLIGATIONS
                2.1 TaskHub provides the TaskHub Platform only, enabling Users to publish and make Offers on Posted Tasks or publish Offers for Services or make Instant Claims of Tasker Listings.

                2.8 Except for liability in relation to any Non-excludable Condition, the TaskHub Service is provided on an "as is" basis, and without any warranty or condition, express or implied.

                3.11 You must not request payments outside of the TaskHub Platform from the Poster for the Services except to the extent permitted by clause 3.12 and only if the TaskHub Platform does not facilitate the reimbursement via the Payment Account of costs considered in clause 3.12.

TaskHub advises Taskers not to agree to incur costs in advance of receiving the payment for these costs, unless the Tasker is confident the Poster will reimburse the costs promptly.
                3.13 For the proper operation of the TaskHub Platform (including insurance, proper pricing and compliance with Policies), the Tasker must ensure that, if it subcontracts any part of the performance of the Services to a third party in accordance with a Task Contract, then that third party must also be a registered User of the TaskHub Platform.
                3.14 If TaskHub determines at its sole discretion that You have breached any obligation under this clause 3 or that You have breached one or more Task Contracts, it reserves the rights to remove any content, Posted Task or Offer You have submitted to the TaskHub Service or cancel or suspend Your account and/or any Task Contracts.
                4. FEES
                4.1 A Poster Service Fee is payable to TaskHub in respect of bookings made on the Platform. When a Customer accepts a Tasker's offer a Task Contract is formed between the two parties. At this time the Customer will be charged the Agreed Price plus the Poster Service Fee.
                4.2 When a Customer releases the Task Payment to the Tasker, the Tasker Service Fee and the Poster Service Fee will be retained by TaskHub.

                5. PAYMENTS AND REFUNDS
                5.1 If the Task Contract is cancelled for any reason (by a Poster, a Tasker or under this Agreement) prior to the commencement of the Task Contract, then if TaskHub is reasonably satisfied that the Agreed Price should be returned to the Poster then the Agreed Price will be refunded to the Poster as Stored Value and a Cancellation Admin Fee will be due to TaskHub by the User who the cancellation of the Task Contract is attributable to under clause 5.5 or 5.6.
                5.2 TaskHub may decide in its absolute discretion to refund the Agreed Price back onto the Poster's credit card instead of Stored Value or waive the Cancellation Admin Fee.
                5.3 Any amount returned by TaskHub to a Poster on behalf of a Tasker under clause 5.1 will be a debt owed by the Tasker to TaskHub and may be offset by TaskHub against any other payments owed at any time to the Tasker.
                5.4 Any outstanding Cancellation Admin Fee owed by a User under clause 5.1 will be a debt owed by that User to TaskHub and may also be offset by TaskHub against any other payments owed at any time to the User.
                5.5 Cancellation of a Task Contract will be attributable to the Tasker where:
                (a) the Poster and the Tasker mutually agree to cancel the Task Contract; or
                (b) following reasonable but unsuccessful attempts by a Poster to contact a Tasker to perform the Task Contract, the Task Contract is cancelled by the Poster; or
                (c) the Tasker cancels the Task Contract; or
                (d) a Task Contract is cancelled in accordance with clause 3.14 as a result of the Tasker’s actions or breach.
                5.6 A Cancellation of a Task Contract will be attributable to a Poster where:
                (a) the Poster cancels the Task Contract (other than in accordance with clause 5.5(b); or
                (b) a Task Contract is cancelled in accordance with clause 3.14 as a result of the Poster’s actions or breach.
                5.7 If the parties agree to any additional cancellation fee payable under the Task Contract, it is the responsibility of the party to claim any amount owed directly from the other.
                5.8 TaskHub may take up to 14 days to return the Agreed Price (less the Cancellation Admin Fee, if applicable) to the Poster.
                5.9 If, for any reason, the Tasker Funds cannot be transferred or otherwise made to the Tasker or returned to the Poster (as the case may be) or no claim is otherwise made for the Tasker Funds, the Tasker Funds will remain in the Payment Account until paid or otherwise for up to three months from the date the Poster initially paid the Agreed Price into the Payment Account.
                5.10 Following the 3 months referred to in clause 5.9, and provided there is still no dispute in respect of the Tasker Funds, the Tasker Funds will be credited to the Poster as Stored Value.
                5.11 If the Task Contract is cancelled and a User who is party to the Task Contract can show that work under a Task Contract was commenced, then the amount of the Agreed Price to be returned to the Poster will be conditional upon the mediation and dispute process in clause 18. However, the Cancellation Admin Fee will always be due in accordance with clause 5.1.
                6. STORED VALUE
                6.1 Stored Value:

                (d) are valid for 12 months from the date on which that particular Stored Value is applied to a User's account, the date of issue or purchase or any expiry date applied by TaskHub (conditional upon any contrary specific jurisdictional legislative requirements);
                (e) if the Stored Value is acquired other than under this Agreement, it may also be conditional on compliance with additional, or different, terms and conditions, as specified in relation to Stored Value, such as a restriction on when the Stored Value is redeemable (for example only for a User's first Task Contract), specify a minimum Services value, or specify a maximum credit or discount value; and
                (f) must not be reproduced, copied, distributed, or published directly or indirectly in any form or by any means for use by an entity other than the credited User, or stored in a data retrieval system, without TaskHub 's prior written permission.
                6.2 The User credited with a Stored Value is solely responsible for the security of any Stored Value. Save for the Non-Excludable Conditions, TaskHub will have no liability for any loss or damage to the Stored Value and does not have any obligation to replace Stored Value.
                6.3 TaskHub will not accept, and may refuse or cancel, any Stored Value, which it reasonably determines in its discretion, have been used in breach of this Agreement or have been forged, tampered with, or are otherwise fraudulent and TaskHub reserves the right to refer any suspected fraudulent activity to relevant law enforcement authorities. In particular, Stored Value, such as promotional coupons, vouchers or codes distributed or circulated without our approval, for example on an internet message board or on a "bargains" website, are not valid for use and may be refused or cancelled.
